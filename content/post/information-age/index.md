I learned at University that we are at the Information Age. That is true and
everybody knows it. But why have I decided to learn how to code?

First of all, when I moved to London I had a little experience as a librarian,
that I got at my last job in Brazil. I thought it would be easy to find a job
as a librarian here in London. The first place I looked for jobs was The
British Library. Poor me. I didn’t know that it's not that simple: there are a
lot of other people who had the same idea, in the same period that I had, all
fighting for the same few places.

After more than a year in London and seeing my husband enjoying his work, I
realized the importance of programming, which involves a combination of several
technical skills, such as writing a program and how to search for something
when you are stuck with a problem or an error message. The power to find an
answer to a technical problem focuses on the ability to accurately assess a
situation and thus arrive at a positive solution or at least some indication
that we are on the right track.

I notice that my partner applies the same logical form of thinking to solve not
only technical problems, but all sort of problems, and that sometimes
astonishes me! Of course, this is also part of the personal development, but
this ability can also be acquired through the constant exercise of
problem-solving, a thing that a software engineer does on a daily basis.

Another thing that attracted me to the field is the possibility to work less or
even work at home or remotely. That was another potentiality that makes me look
at this career with more attention. Finally, I started attending several Tech
Meetups, especially events specific to women. After almost two years and now
that I have a better understanding of English, I saw that as one of the best
opportunities study programming, gain confidence, and learn from different
backgrounds what processes and ways to overcome obstacles are most effective. 

Something I’ve learned in the past few months:

* Perfection is an illusion
* It’s OK to ask for help
* Progress is linear
* Having a bad day is normal
 
__Don’t compare your back-of-stage to everyone else’s front-of-stage__. Look
inside and see what you have and be grateful.
