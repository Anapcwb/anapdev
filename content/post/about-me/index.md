**When did you first start coding?**

My first experience with computers and programming was in a course named
*Complete Professional Windows*, in 1995 back in Brazil. It was really early
days and it was kind of hard to deal with those machines. At that time I was
working with Human Resources. It’s a shame I didn’t follow the IT path earlier
in my life. I know now that chance I’ve lost. We learned BASIC in the course.
That was also my first experience with DOS and I didn’t even know I was coding.

After that, I drastically changed paths. I abandoned the College course I was
taking (economics) and went into a new life on the other side of the world. I
moved to Japan and spent the next ten years working in factories, manufacturing
car parts. Yes, I learned a bit of Japanese, not as much I’d like but I think I
can find my way there. As I’m planning a trip to Japan next year, I guess I’ll
put that to test!

In 2008 I returned to Brazil with a single goal: to take on higher education.
For my luck, in 2009 I met my sweet partner in life and I’d say he was the most
important person for my success in that journey. In 2010 I started to study for
the University entrance exams and, between other things, he practically
developed a maths textbook for me. After almost ten years virtually without
studying, I don’t really know how I could have done it without his support and
effort in teaching me. Thanks baby! 

I got a BSc degree Information Management from Universidade Federal do Parana
(2011 - 2014). In October 2015 we moved to London. I started to learn English
and my lovely husband, with his passion for programming, started to encourage me
to study programming too. 

My progress wasn’t the fastest, but it was steady. I was also working on
improving other aspects of my life and that has been helping me to become a
better person and a better student.

In May 2019, I’m starting a Bootcamp on the [Wild Code
School](http://wildcodeschool.com) in London. I’m
planning to share my findings and learning here with you all :)

See you soon!
